gitlab Branch(Andrew)       ### The Sprint2 final version is in this Branch###

As a scrum master, I organized 5 formal group meeting, which include 4 face to face 
meeting and 1 online meeting (by group chatting) during Sprint2

The 1st group meeting: revised for sprint1
The 2nd group meeting: sprint2: discuss and set up the work draft
The 3rd & 4th group meeting: come up with more specific designs(UI, Core:Database)
The 5th group meeting: distribute the detailed of tasks to each group member

There are 4 parts of work
-> DB (doc table & patient table)
-> UI (review sys, patient appointment management, doctor schedule management)
-> Connectivity (database and activity)
-> UML documentation (Use cases)

Work completed(delivered)
a) Initial database design which includes Patient Table & Doctor Table 
b) Patient Signup/login,Doctor Signup/login Database and activity connectivity

doctor database table with new added column. And complete the connectivity.
